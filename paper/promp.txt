You are assisting in writing an academic course report for a Master’s-level NLP project in Data Science.

The project focuses on replicating the paper “Chronos-2: From Univariate to Universal Forecasting” in order to validate its methodology and experimental results. The report should clearly state that replication is a core objective, followed by exploratory extensions built on top of the original framework.

In addition to replication, the project investigates high-level extensions, without going deeply into technical implementation details yet:

Replacing dense temporal attention with sparse attention to improve efficiency.

Combining cross-learning with cross-group learning to enhance generalization across time-series groups.

Making conceptual improvements to the quantile prediction function to address limitations observed in probabilistic forecasting.

i want to Write in a clear, academic style suitable for a short (4-page) report.
i want your help to continue in writing the paper.
Avoid overclaiming novelty, do not assume final results, and keep descriptions general and conceptual where details are not finalized.
The tone should reflect a replication study with thoughtful extensions rather than a fully novel model.
