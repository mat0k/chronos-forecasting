    "# Chronos-2 Soft Group Masking Extension - Progress Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Hard group masking in Chronos-2 can block useful information when related time series are placed in different groups. Relaxing this constraint via similarity-weighted soft masking could allow beneficial cross-group learning while maintaining group structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Instead of binary masking (attend=1, ignore=0), use continuous weights (0 to 1) based on how similar series are, allowing the model to learn from related series even across group boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified Chronos-2 to add soft masking capability (inference-only, no training required):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core changes**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Compute similarity between all time series in batch\n",
    "similarity_matrix = compute_input_similarity(context, similarity_type=\"correlation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Convert similarity to soft attention mask\n",
    "# Within-group: similarity = 1.0 (full attention)\n",
    "# Cross-group: similarity = computed value (0 to 1)\n",
    "soft_mask = hard_mask + (1 - hard_mask) * similarity_matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Apply temperature scaling and convert to attention bias\n",
    "attention_bias = log(soft_mask) × temperature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modified files**: `model.py` (soft mask construction), `pipeline.py` (similarity computation and parameter passing)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarity Matrix: What We Use and Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity matrix determines how much cross-group attention is allowed. We implemented three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Correlation (Pearson)** - Currently Used\n",
    "- Measures linear relationships between series\n",
    "- Best for: Series with similar patterns but different scales\n",
    "- Formula: Normalized covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Cosine Similarity** - Available, Not Yet Tested\n",
    "- Measures directional similarity (ignores magnitude)\n",
    "- Best for: Series with similar shapes but different amplitudes\n",
    "- Formula: Angle between vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Distance (Gaussian Kernel)** - Available, Not Yet Tested\n",
    "- Measures numerical proximity\n",
    "- Best for: Series that are close in value space\n",
    "- Formula: exp(-euclidean_distance / scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temperature Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: Controls how permissive cross-group attention is\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low temperature (e.g., 1.0)**: Stricter - only very similar series attend across groups (closer to hard masking)\n",
    "- **High temperature (e.g., 20.0)**: Permissive - even moderately similar series can share information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical effect**: `attention_bias = log(similarity) × temperature`\n",
    "- Acts as a scaling factor for cross-group information flow\n",
    "- Higher temperature amplifies the effect of similarity differences\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested the soft masking approach on multiple datasets with varying characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key findings**:\n",
    "1. **Unrelated series (M4 Hourly)**: No improvement - as expected, cross-group learning doesn't help when series are from different domains\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Related series (ETT datasets)**: Small improvements (~6% on full data)\n",
    "   - Statistically significant with large samples\n",
    "   - **BUT**: Predictions are 98% identical to baseline (high correlation)\n",
    "   - Only ~61% of samples improved (barely better than random)\n",
    "   - Suggests **smoothing effect** rather than meaningful cross-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Small vs large samples**: Improvement dropped from 28% (100 samples) to 6% (117k samples)\n",
    "   - Indicates overfitting on small samples\n",
    "   - Real effect is much smaller than initially observed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current interpretation**: Soft masking provides marginal benefit in current configuration - potentially just reducing prediction variance rather than enabling meaningful cross-group learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Still to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if soft masking can provide meaningful improvements, we need to test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different similarity measures**: \n",
    "   - Cosine similarity (shape-based)\n",
    "   - Distance-based (proximity-based)\n",
    "   - Compare which captures useful relationships best\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temperature sweep**: \n",
    "   - Test 1.0, 10.0, 20.0 (only tested 5.0 so far)\n",
    "   - Find optimal trade-off between group separation and cross-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Different datasets**:\n",
    "   - Weekly vs hourly granularity\n",
    "   - Datasets with stronger inter-series relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deeper analysis**:\n",
    "   - Per-feature results (which features benefit?)\n",
    "   - Temporal patterns (does it help more for short/long-term forecasts?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Determine if there's a configuration where soft masking provides substantial practical benefit, or conclude it's not effective for inference-only scenarios.\n",

    "## Conclusion for Your Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results, here's what you can conclude:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Finding: Soft Group Masking Shows NO Meaningful Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Summary:**\n",
    "- MASE improvement: +2.80% (p=0.26, **not significant**)\n",
    "- WQL improvement: +0.02% (p=0.98, **not significant**)\n",
    "- Cohen's d for MASE: 0.0116 (**negligible** - needs >0.2 for \"small\")\n",
    "- Cohen's d for WQL: 0.0002 (**negligible**)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What This Means:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypothesis NOT supported**: The soft group masking extension does **not provide meaningful improvements** over standard hard group masking when applied at inference-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect size reveals the truth**: While there's a 2.8% MASE improvement on average, Cohen's d = 0.0116 indicates this is **practically meaningless**. Even if it were statistically significant (which it isn't), the effect is too small to matter in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistent with individual dataset findings**: This aligns with your earlier tests on ETT_1H (d=0.2), Walmart (d=0.04), where effect sizes were negligible despite small percentage improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Possible Explanations (for Discussion section):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training-inference mismatch**: The model was trained with hard group masking. Introducing soft masking only at inference creates a distribution shift the model wasn't prepared for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learned group structures are sufficient**: Chronos-2 may have already learned to encode relationship patterns during pretraining. The hard group boundaries at inference don't limit performance because the encoder already captured cross-series patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Similarity metric limitations**: Pearson correlation on raw context may not capture the semantic relationships the model uses internally. The model's learned representations may encode more complex relationships than simple correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Small batch sizes**: Most benchmark datasets have small batches (5-862 series). With hard masking already grouping all series together (group_id=0 in default mode), soft masking provides minimal additional benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendations for Report:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section: Results**\n",
    "```\n",
    "We evaluated the soft group masking extension on 25 datasets from the \n",
    "Chronos Benchmark II zero-shot evaluation suite. Soft masking showed \n",
    "a 2.80% improvement in MASE and 0.02% in WQL over baseline hard \n",
    "masking. However, paired t-tests revealed these differences were not \n",
    "statistically significant (MASE: p=0.26; WQL: p=0.98). More critically, \n",
    "effect size analysis (Cohen's d) showed negligible practical significance \n",
    "(MASE: d=0.0116; WQL: d=0.0002), far below the 0.2 threshold for \n",
    "\"small\" effects.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section: Conclusion**\n",
    "```\n",
    "The inference-only soft group masking extension does not provide \n",
    "meaningful improvements over standard Chronos-2. We conclude that:\n",
    "(1) hard group masking boundaries are not a limiting factor at inference,\n",
    "(2) modifications to attention mechanisms likely require corresponding \n",
    "changes during training to be effective, and (3) the model's pretrained \n",
    "representations already capture sufficient cross-series relationships.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section: Future Work**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Future research should explore:\n",
    "- Training Chronos models with soft group masking from scratch\n",
    "- Alternative similarity metrics based on learned embeddings rather than raw values\n",
    "- Adaptive temperature parameters learned per-dataset\n",
    "- Ablation studies on different batch sizes and group configurations\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **This is a VALID research contribution!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative results are valuable - you've shown that a seemingly reasonable hypothesis (soft masking should help) **does not hold in practice**. This saves other researchers time and provides insights into how Chronos-2 actually works."
